      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;heres-the-quick-breakdown&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the quick breakdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have over twelve years of writing experience in tech and government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love using free and open-source software wherever and whenever I can. Yes, that means Linux, among many other projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of my hobbies include: tinkering with my homelab, reading, studying, playing video games, writing, and woodworking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!!! And don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on &lt;strong&gt;mechanical keyboards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wanted a free space where I could write about whatever I wanted. For years, I looked at people with their own websites, unsure of how they did it. Slowly but surely, I learned about managing a website, making a start at Squarespace. Finding that far too expensive, I went to WordPress, then a locally-installed WordPress installation. And here I am in what I hope is the final form. (I am using the Hugo static site generator and a git repository.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proxying Docker containers on a separate VLAN</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to start this off by clearly stating that I&amp;rsquo;m not a network engineer, nor do I know how to be one. That said, however, a project idea came to me one day as I thought about breaking myself free from Cloudflare Tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built a weird setup with a Raspberry Pi, Nginx Proxy Manager, a separate VLAN, and a series of Docker containers that I wanted to access externally. I wasted hours, days, in pure frustration, only to find out that the solution was so simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Kobo sync with Calibre Web</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There I was, minding my own business downloading ebooks from my Calibre server to my Kobo Libra 2 via the web browser when I stumbled upon a comment. This comment, courtesy of a now unknown Redditor, briefly mentioned something I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of. Apparently, Calibre Web, the very service I used to sideload books onto my Kobo, had a built-in Kobo sync feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared incredulously at this comment, and then started to do some digging. I even ventured onto Google to find answers, as DuckDuckGo proved unable to pinpoint the exact information I needed. Sure enough, I found what I wanted, or at least the beginnings of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
