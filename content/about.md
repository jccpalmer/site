### Here's the quick breakdown

* I have over thirteen years of writing experience in tech and government.
* I love using free and open-source software wherever and whenever I can. Yes, that means Linux, among many other projects.
* Some of my hobbies include: tinkering with my homelab, reading, studying, playing video games, writing, and woodworking.

### Purpose

I always wanted a free space where I could write about whatever I wanted. For years, I looked at people with their own websites, unsure of how they did it. Slowly but surely, I learned about managing a website, making a start at Squarespace. Finding that far too expensive, I went to WordPress, then a locally-installed WordPress installation. And here I am in what I hope is the final form. (I am using the Hugo static site generator and a git repository.)

In all of my years of writing, I felt limited by the site's area of expertise. While I excel at writing about smartphones, or video games, or computers, I have interests far outside of those â€” or too far in-depth for my employers' liking. My stint at Tom's Guide, for example, was too generalist.

So I finally decided to turn my dreams of owning my own website into a reality. Here is where I can write about whatever catches my fancy, whether it's my latest homelab project or philosophical musings, or a review on a product or piece of media that caught my attention (for better or for worse).
